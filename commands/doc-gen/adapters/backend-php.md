description: Stub adapter for PHP backend documentation workflow

Support for `backend-php` projects is forthcoming. During orchestration runs, concentrate on routing definitions, controllers, service providers, queue workers, and deployment routines. Record specific TODO markers so the adapter can be expanded later. Honor the `--language` selection when emitting notes.
