description: Stub adapter for web admin documentation workflow

Implementation pending. Use the core orchestrator to gather context and produce a TODO backlog noting that detailed guidance for `web-admin` remains to be authored. Mark these items with `automation=manual`, check them off as `[x] (manual follow-up required)`, and ensure `_reports/todo.json` and README clearly signal the gap. Recommend focusing on route definitions, RBAC modules, dashboard data sources, and analytics integrations when drafting documentation manually. Capture a stub reminder inside `<docs target>/_reports/parameters.json`, and ensure any interim notes adopt the selected `--language`.
