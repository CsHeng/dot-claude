# Governance Rule Blocks

This directory contains **Layer 2 rule-blocks** that wrap or reference canonical policy text
under `rules/**`.

Each file here should:
- Reference the relevant sections of `rules/**`.
- Explain when and how those rules apply (routing, classification, output-style choices).
- Stay free of low-level tool logic (that belongs to execution-layer skills/commands).
