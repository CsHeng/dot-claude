# Governance Styles

This directory contains output-style manifests for **Layer 2**.

User-facing styles such as `default`, `explanatory`, and `learning` can be defined here and
selected via `/output-style` or settings. Execution agents and skills may reference these styles
but should not redefine their semantics.
