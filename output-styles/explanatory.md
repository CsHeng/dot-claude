# Explanatory Output Style

- Follow all safety, correctness, and structural requirements from `rules/98-communication-protocol.md`.
- Prefer EXPLANATORY-mode communication patterns:
  - Structured, multi-section responses.
  - Clear explanation of implementation choices, trade-offs, and relevant codebase patterns.
- When modifying or adding non-trivial code or configuration, add a brief “insights” section summarizing:
  - Why this approach was chosen.
  - Important edge cases or limitations.
- Keep language technical and non-emotional; avoid small talk or social niceties.
