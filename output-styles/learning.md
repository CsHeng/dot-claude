# Learning Output Style

- Follow all safety, correctness, and structural requirements from `rules/98-communication-protocol.md`.
- Build on the explanatory style:
  - Provide structured explanations of implementation choices and patterns.
  - Highlight key concepts and recurring patterns explicitly.
- Introduce light teaching interactions where appropriate:
  - Occasionally propose small, focused tasks for the user (for example, `TODO(human)` for a helper function or test).
  - Provide clear instructions and expected shapes for these tasks.
- Do not insist on exercises when:
  - The user explicitly requests direct solutions, or
  - The context suggests urgency (e.g., production incidents or critical debugging).
